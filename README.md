# Oh, CV!

Word and LaTeX are too overkill for a curriculum vitae / resume.

So why not write it in Markdown?

## Development

It's built on [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse), with the power of [Vue 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next), [Vite 3](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) and [UnoCSS](https://github.com/antfu/unocss).

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build some [packages](packages):

```bash
pnpm build:pkg
```

To enable picking fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), you will need to generate a [Google Fonts Developer API Key](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api#APIKey). Then, create a `.env` file in [`site`](site/) folder and put:

```
VITE_GOOGLE_FONTS_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Start developing / building the site:

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm build
```
